!!
!! WebConfigure configuration parameters
!!
!! The application must be restarted for changes to take effect.
!! This usually means restarting the servlet container.
!!

!!
!! Relay database connection driver.
!! Just have to ensure that the appropriate driver is in the CLASSPATH!
!! You'll have to setup the build.xml file to include the appropriate
!! .JAR file with the build.
drivername=oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver

!!
!! Relay database URL.
!!
!! This is the JDBC URL that is used to connect to the Relay database.
!! It is dependent on the JDBC driver specified in the 'drivername' parameter.
!!
!! "sunora" - swlab - mississauga provisioning
!! dburl=jdbc:oracle:thin:@sunora.rim.net:1521:r2db01
!!
!! "r1db01" - swlab - production
!! dburl=jdbc:oracle:thin:@r1-db-01.swlab.rim.net:1521:r1db01
!!
!! "r2db01" - swlab
!! dburl=jdbc:oracle:thin:@r2-db-01.swlab.rim.net:1521:r2db01
!!
!! "r3db01" - swlab
!!dburl=jdbc:oracle:oci8:@r3db01
!!
!! "r4db01" - swlab
dburl=jdbc:oracle:thin:@<%= @dburl %>
!!
!! Relay database username and password.
!! Username and password to connect to the Relay database for administrative
!! functions - things that the code needs to do not specific to an individual user,
!! such as reading and modifying the Relay configuration.
!!
username=<%= @rlydb_username %>
password=<%= @rlydb_passwd %>
!!
!! Support for locking the Relay database user account in production.
!! 'produser' is the owner of the DB objects in production.
!! The 'username' and 'password' parameters are used to connect to the application user in production.
!! In other environments, where relay and other applications share the same username/password,
!! 'produser' can be set to the 'username' value or left blank.
!!
!! Example for production:
!! username=webconf_user
!! password=webconf_password
!! produser=relay
!!
!! Example for an unsecured environment:
!! username=relay_user
!! password=relay_password
!! produser=relay_user    -- OR -- produser=
produser=relay

!!
!! Route Service support.
!! This parameter enables WebConfigure's Route Service features.
!! It's main purpose is to allow WebConfigure to be backwards-compatible with Relay versions that do not
!! support Route Service. If set to anything other than 'true', WebConfigure will hide all pages related
!! to Route Service, and disable all functions that make use of Route Service and its database tables.
routeservice.supported=true

!!
!! Route Service database connection parameters.
!! The following parameters are equivalent to the ones used to set up the Relay database connection.
!! 'routeservice.dburl' is dependent upon the JDBC driver specified by the 'drivername' parameter.
!! If no 'routeservice.dburl' is specified, WebConfigure will assume Route Service configuration is
!! stored on the Relay database and 'routeservice.username', 'routeservice.password' and
!! 'routeservice.produser' will be ignored.
!! WebConfigure will also assume Route Service configuration is stored on the Relay database if these
!! parameters are set to the same values as 'dburl', 'username', 'password' and 'produser'.
!!
!! NOTE: For Route Service database connections to be set up, 'routeservice.supported' must be set to 'true'.
!!
!!routeservice.dburl=jdbc:oracle:thin:@r4-db-01.swlab.rim.net:1521:r4db01
!!routeservice.username=relay
!!routeservice.password=relay
!!routeservice.produser=relay
routeservice.dburl=jdbc:oracle:thin:@<%= @dburl %>
routeservice.username=RteSvAdm
routeservice.produser=RteSVAdm
routeservice.password=rou8svadm
routeservice.supported=true


!!
!! RSCI database connection parameters.
!! A connection to the RSCI database is required to access GUID configuration.
!! Example format:
!!     rsci.dburl=jdbc:oracle:thin:@dev-db-21.swlab.rim.net:1521:devdb21c
!!
rsci.dburl=jdbc:oracle:thin:@(DESCRIPTION =(ADDRESS_LIST =(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = s11-rca01.rly11.blackberry)(PORT = 1525))(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = s11-rcb01.rly11.blackberry)(PORT = 1525)))(ENABLE = BROKEN)(CONNECT_DATA =(SERVICE_NAME = NARSCI)(SERVER = DEDICATED)))
rsci.username=SRPKEYMGR
rsci.password=SRPKEYMGR

!!
!! Unique name for this instance of WebConfigure.
!! Every component is identified by a unique database service name.  This name is found in the SERVICENAME field
!! of the RELAYCONFIG table and used in the RELAYCOMPONENT table.  It is mandatory to have a service name.
relaycomponent.dsn=<%= @rlycomponent_dsn %>
relaycomponent.BindToIP=<%= @bindtoip %>


!!
!! IP address that WebConfigure will bind to for listening to Relay IRP traffic (unicast).
!! If an address is not specified, WebConfigure will attempt to determine a local IP address.
!! On startup, the 'relaycomponent.dsn' and 'relaycomponent.BindToIP' address combination will be used to claim
!! a relay component id and a port number for this WebConfigure instance.


!!
!! RIM AD host and domain for validation.
!!
ldapurl=<%= @ldap_url %>

!!
!! How long (in ms) a result from a handheldDeviceStateRequest is cached by WebConfigure
!!
deviceStateCacheLength=120000

!!
!! How long to wait (in ms) while trying to figure out a handheld's device status
!!
deviceStateMaxWait=4000

!!
!! How many RemoveHandheldFromCache messages get sent to all WT/RB/SRPHs before sleeping for cacheClearSleepInterval seconds.
!! If you change this, change handheld.prompt.removefromcache.pin.instructions in ApplicationResources.properties
!!
cacheClearPacingLimit=100

!!
!! How long to sleep, in ms.  (see cacheClearPacingLimit)
!! If you change this, change handheld.prompt.removefromcache.pin.instructions in ApplicationResources.properties
!!
cacheClearSleepInterval=5000

!! Minimum and maximum allowable values for TTL (time-to-live in ms) property in REG_CARRIER table
minTTL=2592000
maxTTL=2592000

!!
!! Refresh period, in milliseconds, of WebConfigure's internal RCID-to-service name map.
!! This map is useful for obtaining the service name of a Relay component when its RCID is known,
!! and it would be preferable to avoid reading it directly from the DB.
